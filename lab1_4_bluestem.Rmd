title: "4. Bluestem Data Assignment"
---

In Part 4, you will apply what you have learned to the bluestem variation data you collected at the Regional Science Center. You will create a new R script, read the bluestem data into R, plot histograms of plant height and rame length, estimate the means of those variables, plot them on bar charts.

### Your assignment

Your assignment is to generate figures and statistical analyses that answer the following question:

    Do plant height or rame length of Big Bluestem (Andropogon) plants vary between burned and unburned sites.

Briefly, you will:

1. Use the [data on big bluestem intraspecific variation](bluestem_data.xlsx) your class collected at the Regional Science Center.
2. Explore how **plant height** varied between the **burned** and **unburned** locations:
    - Create a grouped histogram and bar chart
    - Write a figure legend for each figure
    - Conduct a t-test to test for a statistical difference between the mean plant heights at each location
    - Write a short paragraph summarizing your results.
3. Repeat these steps for **rame lengths**.
4. Copy the figures and text into a Microsoft Word document and upload it to an assignment folder on your LAB (not lecture) D2L site. (see this [example Word document](finch_results.docx))

Your grade for this assignment will be based on the Word document you upload to D2L.

### Bluestem data

Your assignment involves plotting and analyzing the data on instraspecific variation in big bluestem (Andropogon) plants that you collected during a field trip to the Regional Science Center. All the data were entered onto a single Excel spreadsheet.

Each row in the dataset represents an individual plant.

The variables in the dataset are:

- **location** ("burned" vs. "unburned")
- **plant_height** (plant height measured in cm)
- **rame_length** (rame length measured in mm)
- **section** (name of the section the data collector was in)

Download the bluestem dataset:

Open it in Excel if you want to take a look at it.

### Tips

First download the [data](bluestem_data.xlsx). Move it from your Downloads directory to your project directory if you didn't save it there to begin with.

It's always easier to modify existing code than create new code from scratch. Create a new R script, save it as `plant_height.R`, and paste the [code for the finch analysis](finch_analysis.html).

Once you've copied the code, you can work through changing file paths, object names, column names, and axis labels as needed to perform your bluestem data analysis.

After you're done with the **plant height** analysis, you can copy the `plant_height.R` R script and save it as `rame_length.R`. Then all you have to change in that script is replace `plant_heght` with `rame_length` anywhere it appears in the code!

#### Figure legends

For tips on how to write a good figure legend, see [Writing an Effective Figure Legend](https://www.aje.com/en/arc/writing-effective-figure-legend/). In general, a figure legend should provide the following parts:

- Title: A brief title that applies to the entire figure, including all panels.
- Materials and methods: A description of the techniques used.
- Results: A statement of the results that can be gleaned from the particular figure.
- Definitions: An explanation of features in the figure.
