In Part 4, you will apply what you have learned to the bluestem variation data you collected at the Regional Science Center. You will create a new R script, read the bluestem data into R, plot histograms of plant height and rame length, estimate the means of those variables, plot them on bar charts.

### Your assignment

Your assignment is to generate figures and statistical analyses that answer the following question:

<blockquote class="text-success">Do plant height or rame length of Big Bluestem (<i>Andropogon gerrardii</i>) plants vary between burned and unburned sites.</blockquote>

Briefly, you will:

1. Download the bluestem data.
2. Create histograms for **plant height** and **rame length**, grouped by **location**
3. Summarize **plant height** by **location**, create a bar chart with means and confidence intervals, and compare the means with a t-test.
4. Do the same for **rame length**.
4. Copy the figures into a Microsoft Word document, add figure legends (see below for help) and t-test results.
5. Upload the Word document to an assignment folder on your LAB (not lecture) D2L site. **Your grade for this assignment will be based on this Word document.**

#### Example Word Document

Your Word document should look something like this example Word document when completed:

<a href="example_results.docx"><i class="fas fa-file-word fa-5x"></i></a>

The main difference is that you will have four figures (two each for plant height and rame length), four figure legends, and two sets of t-test results.

### Bluestem data

Your assignment involves plotting and analyzing the data on instraspecific variation in big bluestem (*Andropogon gerrardii*) plants that you collected during a field trip to the Regional Science Center. All the data were entered onto a single Excel spreadsheet.

Each row in the dataset represents an individual plant.

The variables in the dataset are:

- **location** ("burned" vs. "unburned")
- **plant_height** (plant height measured in cm)
- **rame_length** (rame length measured in mm)
- **section** (name of the section the data collector was in)

Download the bluestem dataset:

<a href="bluestem_data.xlsx"><i class="fas fa-file-excel fa-5x"></i></a>

Don't forget to move the file to your project directory after downloading it.

### Tips

It's always easier to modify existing code than create new code from scratch. This page will show you how to copy and modify an existing script:

#### [Copy code from beak length analysis  &rarr;](beak_length.html)

Our suggestions:

1. Create a new R script, save it as `plant_height.R`, and paste the code for the finch analysis (link above)
2. Modify the new script so it analyzes plant height from the bluestem dataset rather than beak length from the finches dataset. You'll need to change:
    - name of the data file in your `read_excel()`
    - names of objects (e.g. `finches` to `bluestem`)
    - names of variables (e.g. `beak_length` to `plant_height` and `outcome` to `location`)
    - axis labels in ggplots
3. After you're done with the **plant height** analysis, copy the plant height code and paste it into a new script for **rame length**. 
4. Replace `plant_height` with `rame_length` in the new code.

<span class="label label-success">Pro Tip</span> Use the Find and Replace function by clicking the magnifying glass in the Source tab toolbar. Avoid the temptation to Replace All... instead click through replacing one at a time to make sure you don't change something in a way you didn't intend to.

#### Figure legends

For tips on how to write a good figure legend, see [Writing an Effective Figure Legend](https://www.aje.com/en/arc/writing-effective-figure-legend/). In general, a figure legend should provide the following parts:

- Title: A brief title that applies to the entire figure, including all panels.
- Materials and methods: A description of the techniques used.
- Results: A statement of the results that can be gleaned from the particular figure.
- Definitions: An explanation of features in the figure.

### Saving your files

If you want to save what you have done so you can work on it later, here is the best option:

1. Log in to [Microsoft Office 360](https://www.mnstate.edu/it/office365/) with your StarID
2. Click **OneDrive**
3. Drag your Project folder from the Finder onto the area that says "Drag Files Here"

You may get an error message that it could not upload files starting with a dot ("."), e.g. .Rprofile or .RData. Ignore that warning, those files are not important.

To work on your files again:

1. Log in to [Microsoft Office 360](https://www.mnstate.edu/it/office365/) with your StarID
2. Click **OneDrive**
2. Click the check box next to your Project Folder
3. Click the **Download** button
4. Navigate to your **Downloads** folder in the Finder
5. If you don't see your Project folder there, but you do see a file ending in .zip, click that file and it will extract your Project folder.
6. Start RStudio
7. Open your Project using one of the methods described in [Part 1](lab1_1_rstudio.html).
