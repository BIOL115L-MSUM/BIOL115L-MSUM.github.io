title: "4. Bluestem Data Assignment"
---

In Part 4, you will apply what you have learned to the bluestem variation data you collected at the Regional Science Center. You will create a new R script, read the bluestem data into R, plot histograms of plant height and rame length, estimate the means of those variables, plot them on bar charts.

### Your assignment

Your assignment is to generate figures and statistical analyses that answer the following question:

<blockquote class="text-success">Do plant height or rame length of Big Bluestem (<i>Andropogon gerrardii</i>) plants vary between burned and unburned sites.</blockquote>

Briefly, you will:

1. Download the bluestem data.
2. Create histograms for **plant height** and **rame length**, grouped by **location**
3. Summarize **plant height** by **location**, create a bar chart with means and confidence intervals, and compare the means with a t-test.
4. Do the same for **rame length**.
4. Copy the figures into a Microsoft Word document, add figure legends (see below for help) and t-test results.
5. Upload the Word document to an assignment folder on your LAB (not lecture) D2L site. **Your grade for this assignment will be based on this Word document.**

#### Example Word Document

Your Word document should look something like this example document when completed:

[EXAMPLE](finch_results.docx)

The main difference is that you will have four figures (two each for plant height and rame length), four figure legends, and two sets of t-test results.

### Bluestem data

Your assignment involves plotting and analyzing the data on instraspecific variation in big bluestem (*Andropogon gerrardii*) plants that you collected during a field trip to the Regional Science Center. All the data were entered onto a single Excel spreadsheet.

Each row in the dataset represents an individual plant.

The variables in the dataset are:

- **location** ("burned" vs. "unburned")
- **plant_height** (plant height measured in cm)
- **rame_length** (rame length measured in mm)
- **section** (name of the section the data collector was in)

Download the bluestem dataset:

<span class="label label-warning">Warning</span> Don't forget to move the file to your project directory after downloading it.

### Tips

It's always easier to modify existing code than create new code from scratch. Create a new R script, save it as `plant_height.R`, and paste the [code for the finch analysis](finch_analysis.html).

Once you've copied the code, you can work through changing file paths, object names, column names, and axis labels as needed to perform your bluestem data analysis.

After you're done with the **plant height** analysis, you can copy the `plant_height.R` R script and save it as `rame_length.R`. Then all you have to change in that script is replace `plant_heght` with `rame_length` anywhere it appears in the code!

#### Figure legends

For tips on how to write a good figure legend, see [Writing an Effective Figure Legend](https://www.aje.com/en/arc/writing-effective-figure-legend/). In general, a figure legend should provide the following parts:

- Title: A brief title that applies to the entire figure, including all panels.
- Materials and methods: A description of the techniques used.
- Results: A statement of the results that can be gleaned from the particular figure.
- Definitions: An explanation of features in the figure.
