## About

Students in Organimsal Biology BIOL 115 at Minnesota State University are invited to participate in bird banding demonstrations at the MSUM Regional Science Center each fall.

The demonstrations are provided by Chris Merkord, Assistant Professor in Biosciences at MSUM and Tim Grieves, Assistant Professor in Biology at NDSU.

## Next Event

Banding may be cancelled in the case of inclement weather.

A final determination will be made 90 minutes (one and a half hours) before the earliest banding session of the day, and will be posted here. For example, if banding begins at 7:30 AM, then any cancellation will be posted here by 6:00 AM.

<strong>It is your responsibility to check here for the go/no-go status of your scheduled bird banding session.</strong>
